# Spatio-Cognitive Abilities and Executive Functioning in Young Adults Using VR

## Project Overview
This project investigates the relationship between spatio-cognitive abilities and executive functioning in young adults through the use of Virtual Reality (VR). The study aims to evaluate how well college students perform on various tasks under both simple and complex visual stimuli and analyze their executive functioning skills using specific performance metrics.

## Participants
A total of 32 college participants were involved in this study, contributing data for analysis.

### Metrics:
- **Task Completion Efficiency**: Number of actions taken to complete a step, time taken to complete a step, missed object interactions, and variability in completing different steps.
- **Movement Efficiency**: Distance in head movement during tasks and overall variability in head movement.
- **Contextual Features**: Amount of gaze time spent on objects during task completion.
  
## Approach
The metrics are compared with their responses to simple and complex visual stimuli to assess their overall executive functioning skills. The results from spatial cognitive tests, including the Block Design Test, are used to determine if there is a correlation between higher executive functioning and enhanced spatial cognition.
Machine learning (ML) techniques are applied to predict scores related to executive functioning, enabling the identification of patterns and relationships between spatio-cognitive abilities and task performance.
